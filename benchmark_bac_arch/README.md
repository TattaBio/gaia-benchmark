# Bacteria-Archaea ortholog benchmark
We compare the search methods on the accuracy of correctly retrieving functional homologs in an archaeal genome (Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM 639 ASM1228v1) given a gene in a bacterial genome (E.coli K-12). The dataset is hosted at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/tattabio/bac_arch_bigene](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tattabio/bac_arch_bigene)

All methods are evaluated and timed in `bac_arch_benchmark.ipynb`
